# ticktacktoeAnimated
Simple Design of a tick tack toe app using react. Based on the incredible lecture by  Mariusz Dabrowski (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h-yZQQnrHg&amp;t=4119s). This integrates the first two codes of the lecture, in a single react application, with the small change that it uses react hooks instead of the class-based approach of the lecture.
